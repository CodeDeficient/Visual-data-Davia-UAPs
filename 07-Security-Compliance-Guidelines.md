# Security and Compliance Guidelines

## 1. Introduction

**Project Title:** Interactive UFO/UAP Sightings Explorer & AI Analyst

This document outlines basic security and compliance considerations for the Interactive UFO/UAP Sightings Explorer application. As a demonstration project using publicly available data and aiming for free-tier deployment, the security scope is limited. However, adherence to fundamental best practices is important.

## 2. Data Security and Privacy

### 2.1. Data Source
*   The primary dataset (NUFORC UFO Sightings) is publicly available. No personally identifiable information (PII) beyond what is already public in the dataset (e.g., comments which might anecdotally mention names, though this is rare and not systematically collected PII) is being collected or stored by this application.
*   The `initial_concept.md` and Davia's documentation on "Data handling" emphasize that Davia itself does not access or read the data of Python tasks during local development; it only uses the OpenAPI specification.

### 2.2. Data at Rest
*   The pre-processed `nuforc_data.parquet` file will be bundled within the Docker container deployed to Google Cloud Run.
*   Google Cloud Run provides encryption at rest for data stored on its platform by default.

### 2.3. Data in Transit
*   Communication between the Vercel-hosted frontend and the Google Cloud Run backend API will occur over HTTPS, which will be enforced by both platforms. This encrypts data in transit.
*   Davia's platform, when generating the UI and interacting with the backend, is assumed to follow secure communication practices.

### 2.4. Sensitive Information
*   No user accounts, passwords, API keys (for external services beyond GCP/Vercel deployment itself), or other sensitive credentials will be managed or stored by the application code.
*   The application does not require users to input any personal data.

## 3. Application Security (Backend API)

### 3.1. Input Validation
*   The FastAPI backend will use Pydantic models for request body and query parameter validation. This helps protect against common injection-style attacks by ensuring data types and formats are as expected.
*   The rule-based AI assistant will process text input. While the risk is low with a rule-based system, input sanitization or careful parsing will be considered to prevent unexpected behavior if queries are malformed, though complex injection is not a primary concern for this type of processing.

### 3.2. Dependency Management
*   Python dependencies will be managed via `requirements.txt`.
*   Regularly updating dependencies to their latest stable versions is a general best practice, though for this short-term project, initial stable versions will be used. Tools like `pip-audit` or GitHub's Dependabot could be used in a longer-term project to monitor for vulnerabilities in dependencies.

### 3.3. API Endpoint Security
*   No authentication/authorization is planned for the API endpoints as the data is public and the application is a demo. If this were a production system with sensitive data or operations, robust authentication (e.g., OAuth2, API Keys) and authorization would be implemented.
*   Rate limiting is not implemented for this demo but would be a consideration for a production API to prevent abuse. Google Cloud Run and API gateways can offer such features.

### 3.4. Error Handling
*   The API will return generic error messages for unexpected issues, avoiding the exposure of sensitive system information or stack traces in production responses. FastAPI handles this by default for unhandled exceptions.

## 4. Infrastructure Security

### 4.1. Vercel
*   Vercel provides managed infrastructure with built-in security features, including DDoS protection and SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS.
*   Access to the Vercel project will be controlled by the developer's Vercel account.

### 4.2. Google Cloud Run
*   Google Cloud Run runs containers in a secure, managed environment.
*   Google Cloud provides IAM (Identity and Access Management) to control access to GCP resources, including Cloud Run services and Container Registry.
*   Service account permissions for the Cloud Run instance will be configured with the minimum necessary privileges (though for this app, it primarily needs to run the container and serve traffic, not access other GCP services).

### 4.3. Docker Security
*   The `Dockerfile` will be constructed to be minimal, using an official Python base image.
*   No unnecessary services or packages will be included in the container.
*   The container will run with a non-root user if easily configurable and best practice for the chosen base image.

## 5. Compliance

### 5.1. GDPR/CCPA
*   As the application does not collect, store, or process personal data from users (beyond what's inherent in the public UFO dataset itself), specific GDPR/CCPA compliance measures related to user data are not directly applicable to the application's operation.
*   The focus is on responsible handling of the public dataset.

### 5.2. Davia AI Platform
*   Adherence to Davia AI's terms of service and developer guidelines is implied.
*   The application will use the Davia SDK as intended.

## 6. Security Best Practices Summary for this Project

*   Use HTTPS for all communication.
*   Validate and sanitize inputs to the backend API (FastAPI/Pydantic helps).
*   Keep application dependencies in mind (though updates are unlikely during the short project span).
*   Rely on the security features provided by Vercel and Google Cloud Run.
*   Do not hardcode any sensitive information (though none is expected for this project).
*   The dataset is public; no new PII is being collected.

This document provides a basic overview of security and compliance. For a production application, a more comprehensive security assessment and implementation of advanced security measures would be necessary.
