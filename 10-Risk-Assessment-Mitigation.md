# Risk Assessment and Mitigation Plan

## 1. Introduction

**Project Title:** Interactive UFO/UAP Sightings Explorer & AI Analyst

This document outlines potential risks associated with the development and deployment of the Interactive UFO/UAP Sightings Explorer application, along with corresponding mitigation strategies. Given this is a short-term demonstration project for a job application, the scope of risks considered is primarily focused on successful project completion and meeting evaluation criteria.

## 3. Detailed Risk Mitigation Strategies

### R01: Davia SDK Limitations
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Early Exploration:** Dedicate initial development time to experimenting with the Davia SDK's core components for visualization and interactivity using simple mock data.
    *   **Documentation Review:** Continuously refer to Davia's official documentation and any available examples or community forums.
    *   **Flexible Design:** If a specific advanced UI feature proves difficult, be prepared to simplify or use an alternative approach that still meets the core requirement of interactivity.

### R02: Google Cloud Run Deployment Issues
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Local Docker Testing:** Ensure the Docker container runs correctly locally (`docker run ...`) before attempting to deploy to Cloud Run.
    *   **Incremental Deployment:** Deploy a very basic "hello world" FastAPI app to Cloud Run first to verify the deployment pipeline. Then incrementally add features.
    *   **GCP Logs:** Utilize Cloud Logging extensively to diagnose any container startup or runtime errors on Cloud Run.
    *   **`.gcloudignore`:** Use a `.gcloudignore` file to prevent unnecessary files from being uploaded, which can speed up deployments and reduce image size.

### R03: Frontend-Backend Integration Issues
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **OpenAPI Validation:** Use tools like Swagger Editor or linters to validate the `openapi.json` generated by FastAPI.
    *   **Independent API Testing:** Test all backend API endpoints thoroughly using Postman, `curl`, or FastAPI's `TestClient` before expecting the Davia frontend to consume them.
    *   **Browser Developer Tools:** Check the network tab and console in browser developer tools for errors when interacting with the Vercel-deployed frontend. Pay attention to CORS issues if they arise (though Cloud Run with `--allow-unauthenticated` and Vercel usually handle this well for public APIs).

### R04: Large Parquet File / Slow Load Times
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Aggressive Preprocessing:** During the offline data preprocessing, be rigorous in selecting only essential columns and filtering out rows that are not useful or have too much missing data for key fields.
    *   **Efficient Data Types:** Use the most memory-efficient data types in Pandas before saving to Parquet (e.g., `category` for low-cardinality strings, appropriate integer/float sizes).
    *   **Cloud Run Configuration:** Monitor memory usage. If necessary, slightly increase Cloud Run instance memory (e.g., from 256Mi to 512Mi), but be mindful of free tier limits.

### R05: Dataset Quality Issues
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Thorough EDA:** Spend adequate time on exploratory data analysis of the raw NUFORC dataset to understand its quirks, missing data patterns, and inconsistencies.
    *   **Robust Cleaning Script:** Develop a Python script for preprocessing that handles potential errors (e.g., unparseable dates, text in numeric fields) gracefully. Document all cleaning decisions.

### R06: Time Constraints
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **MVP Focus:** Prioritize implementing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that fulfills all core requirements of the job application.
    *   **Timeboxing:** Allocate specific time slots for development, testing, and documentation.
    *   **Documentation Templates:** Using the provided document structure as templates will speed up the documentation process. Fill them iteratively.

### R07: Exceeding Free Tier Limits
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Monitor Dashboards:** Regularly check usage dashboards on Google Cloud Platform and Vercel.
    *   **Cloud Run `min-instances=0`:** Ensure Google Cloud Run services are configured with `min-instances` set to 0 to scale to zero and avoid charges when not in use.
    *   **Resource Cleanup:** Delete any test deployments or unused GCP/Vercel resources promptly.

### R08: AI Assistant Complexity/Feel
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Focus on "Thoughtful SDK Use":** The primary goal is to show how the Davia SDK can be used. The "AI" is a secondary, impressive feature.
    *   **Simple Rules:** Implement a few clear, effective rules for the AI assistant (e.g., "how many in [state]?", "show [shape]").
    *   **Transparency:** If necessary, briefly explain in the submission email or app description that it's a rule-based assistant designed to demonstrate the concept.

### R10: Misunderstanding Expectations
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Adherence to Job Description:** Continuously refer back to the job description, especially the "Application Requirement" section.
    *   **Focus on Core Request:** "Build a small data app using Davia’s Python SDK... We’re not judging for complexity—just creativity and thoughtful use of the SDK."
    *   **Polish and Functionality:** Ensure the submitted app is bug-free, deployed correctly, and easy for the evaluators to use.

## 4. Contingency Planning

*   **Backup Dataset:** Identify an alternative, smaller, or cleaner public dataset if the NUFORC dataset proves too problematic within the project timeline.
*   **Simplified Features:** If specific features (e.g., complex map interactions, certain AI query types) become major roadblocks, be prepared to simplify them to ensure a functional core application is delivered.

By proactively considering these risks and their mitigation strategies, the project has a higher likelihood of successful completion and meeting the objectives of the Davia AI job application.
