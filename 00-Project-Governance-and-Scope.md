# Project Governance and Scope

## 1. Project Title
Interactive UFO/UAP Sightings Explorer & AI Analyst

## 2. Project Goal
To develop an interactive data application that allows users to explore a dataset of UFO/UAP sightings, filter data, view visualizations, and interact with a simple AI-powered analytical assistant. The application will be built using the Davia Python SDK and deployed with a frontend on Vercel and a backend on Google Cloud Run. This project serves as a demonstration of skills for a Data Scientist position at Davia AI.

## 3. Core Objective
Fulfill the application requirement for Davia AI by building a creative and thoughtful data app using the Davia Python SDK, showcasing proficiency in Python, data handling, API design, and an understanding of user-centric product development.

## 4. Project Scope

### 4.1. In Scope:
*   Development of a Python backend API using FastAPI.
*   Preprocessing of the NUFORC UFO sightings dataset into Parquet format.
*   Integration with the Davia Python SDK for UI generation based on an OpenAPI specification.
*   Implementation of interactive data filtering (date, location, shape) and visualizations (map, summary metrics).
*   Development of a simple rule-based AI analytical assistant.
*   Deployment of the backend to Google Cloud Run.
*   Deployment of the Davia-generated frontend to Vercel.
*   Creation of comprehensive project documentation covering planning, design, development, and deployment.
*   Unit testing for critical backend components.
*   Manual functional and user acceptance testing.

### 4.2. Out of Scope:
*   User authentication or accounts.
*   Real-time data ingestion or updates.
*   Advanced machine learning models for the AI assistant (beyond rule-based).
*   Collection of any new Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
*   Extensive automated frontend testing (due to Davia-generated UI).
*   Formal load testing, penetration testing, or comprehensive cross-browser testing.
*   Management of persistent user-specific data or settings.

## 5. Project Governance

As a solo demonstration project developed by a single applicant, formal governance structures (like steering committees or change advisory boards) are not applicable. However, governance principles will be maintained through:

*   **Adherence to Plan:** The project will follow the plans and standards outlined in the suite of documentation (requirements, architecture, API standards, testing strategy, etc.).
*   **Decision Making:** All technical and design decisions are made by the developer (applicant), guided by:
    *   The requirements of the Davia AI job application.
    *   Best practices for software development and data science.
    *   The capabilities and constraints of the chosen technology stack (Davia SDK, FastAPI, GCP, Vercel).
    *   The goal of producing a high-quality, functional, and well-documented demonstration application.
*   **Standard Setting:** Technical standards (e.g., for coding, API design, documentation) are defined in the respective documentation files and will be adhered to.
*   **Quality Assurance:** Governed by the `06-Testing-Strategy-Document.md`, ensuring the application meets functional requirements and quality expectations through unit testing and manual UAT.
*   **Scope Management:** The scope is defined in section 4.1 and 4.2 of this document and in the `01-Product-Requirements-Document.md`. Any deviations would be an internal decision by the developer, weighed against the project goals and timeline.
*   **Risk Management:** Governed by the `10-Risk-Assessment-Mitigation.md`.
*   **Communication:** For this solo project, communication is internal. If this were a team project, clear communication channels and regular updates would be established.

The primary governance objective is to ensure the project successfully meets the evaluation criteria for the Davia AI Data Scientist role by delivering a thoughtful, well-engineered, and functional data application.
