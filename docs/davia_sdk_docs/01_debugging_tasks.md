# Debugging Tasks

Test tasks to get a UI better adapted to your use case.

Davia’s debug window helps you test tasks locally and validate their outputs.

## [​](#testing-and-chat-integration) Testing and Chat Integration

The debug window allows you to test functions with your own inputs. Once you’re satisfied with the results, you can add the function to chat. This helps Davia understand your data structure and improve the UI to better match your needs.

## [​](#understanding-output-types) Understanding Output Types

When you add a tested function to chat, Davia analyzes the output type and adapts the interface to better handle your specific data structure. This ensures a more tailored and efficient user experience.
