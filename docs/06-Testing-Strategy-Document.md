# Testing Strategy Document

## 1. Introduction

**Project Title:** Interactive UFO/UAP Sightings Explorer & AI Analyst

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Interactive UFO/UAP Sightings Explorer application. The goal is to ensure the application is functional, reliable, and meets the requirements specified in the Product Requirements Document (PRD), particularly demonstrating a robust backend and a correctly functioning Davia-generated frontend.

Given the nature of the project (a job application demo with a focus on the Davia SDK and Python backend), the strategy will prioritize backend unit tests and thorough manual testing of the deployed application.

## 2. Testing Goals

*   Verify that all functional requirements outlined in the PRD are met.
*   Ensure the Python backend API (FastAPI) behaves as expected, correctly processing data and handling requests.
*   Confirm that the Davia-generated frontend interacts correctly with the backend API.
*   Validate data accuracy in visualizations and summaries.
*   Ensure the application is user-friendly and performs adequately.
*   Identify and document any bugs or issues.

## 3. Testing Scope

### 3.1. In Scope
*   **Backend Unit Testing:** Python code for API endpoints, data processing logic, and AI assistant rules.
*   **API Integration Testing (Manual/Automated):** Testing the deployed backend API endpoints directly (e.g., using tools like Postman or `curl`, or via FastAPI's test client).
*   **Frontend Functional Testing (Manual):** Testing the user interface generated by Davia, including all interactive elements (filters, maps, charts, AI query input).
*   **Data Validation:** Ensuring data displayed matches expectations based on filters and queries.
*   **User Acceptance Testing (UAT) (Self-conducted):** Simulating end-user interaction to ensure the application is intuitive and meets the project's goals.
*   **Deployment Verification:** Ensuring the application deploys and runs correctly on Vercel (frontend) and Google Cloud Run (backend).

### 3.2. Out of Scope (for this demo project)
*   **Formal, Extensive Frontend Automated Testing:** Since the frontend is generated by Davia, direct frontend unit/integration testing (e.g., using Selenium, Cypress) is out of scope. Testing will focus on the functionality exposed through the Davia UI.
*   **Load/Stress Testing:** The application is a demo and not intended for high-traffic production use.
*   **Formal Security Penetration Testing:** Basic security considerations will be part of the design, but extensive security testing is out of scope.
*   **Comprehensive Cross-Browser/Cross-Device Testing:** Testing will be performed on one or two modern browsers. Davia's platform is assumed to handle most cross-browser compatibility.

## 4. Testing Levels and Types

### 4.1. Backend Unit Testing
*   **Framework:** `pytest` (a popular Python testing framework).
*   **Focus:**
    *   Test individual functions and methods in the FastAPI application.
    *   Verify data loading and parsing logic.
    *   Test data filtering and aggregation functions.
    *   Test the rules and responses of the AI analytical assistant.
    *   Test API endpoint logic using FastAPI's `TestClient`.
*   **Coverage:** Aim for good coverage of critical backend logic.
*   **Location:** Unit tests will reside in a `tests/` directory within the backend codebase.

### 4.2. API Integration Testing
*   **Method:**
    *   Primarily using FastAPI's `TestClient` for automated integration tests of the API layer.
    *   Manual testing of deployed API endpoints using tools like Postman or Insomnia to verify request/response structures, status codes, and error handling against the OpenAPI specification.
*   **Focus:**
    *   Verify that API endpoints are reachable and respond correctly.
    *   Check request/response schemas, including error responses.
    *   Test parameter validation.

### 4.3. Frontend Functional Testing (Manual)
*   **Method:** Manually interacting with the deployed application on Vercel through a web browser.
*   **Focus:**
    *   Verify all UI elements (filters, maps, charts, text inputs, buttons) are present and functional as generated by Davia.
    *   Test interactive filtering:
        *   Apply various filter combinations (date range, shape, state, country).
        *   Confirm that visualizations (map, charts) and summary metrics update correctly and display accurate data.
    *   Test AI assistant:
        *   Input various predefined questions.
        *   Verify that the assistant provides correct textual answers or updates visualizations/filters as expected.
    *   Test general UI responsiveness and ease of use.
    *   Check for any visual glitches or unexpected behavior in the Davia UI.

### 4.4. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
*   **Method:** Self-conducted UAT, stepping through user stories defined in the PRD.
*   **Focus:**
    *   Ensure the application meets the overall project goals and successfully demonstrates the required skills.
    *   Verify that the application is intuitive and provides a positive user experience.
    *   Confirm that the "story" of the application (exploring UFO data with an AI helper) is effectively conveyed.

## 5. Test Environment

*   **Local Development:** Backend unit tests and initial API tests run locally.
*   **Staging/Production (Deployed):** Frontend functional testing and UAT will be performed on the application deployed to Vercel (frontend) and Google Cloud Run (backend).

## 6. Test Data

*   **Backend Unit Tests:** Use small, controlled mock datasets or subsets of the `nuforc_data.parquet` file to test specific logic.
*   **API/Frontend Testing:** The full, pre-processed `nuforc_data.parquet` file will be used by the deployed backend.

## 7. Test Execution and Reporting

*   **Unit Tests:** Executed automatically (e.g., via a `pytest` command). Results (pass/fail) are immediate.
*   **Manual Tests (API, Frontend, UAT):**
    *   Test cases will be derived from the functional requirements and user stories in the PRD.
    *   A simple checklist or spreadsheet may be used to track execution and results.
    *   Bugs/issues found will be documented with:
        *   Description of the issue.
        *   Steps to reproduce.
        *   Expected result vs. Actual result.
        *   Severity (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low).
        *   Screenshots (if applicable).

## 8. Roles and Responsibilities

*   As this is a solo project for a job application, the developer (applicant) is responsible for all aspects of testing.

## 9. Test Deliverables (Conceptual for this project)

*   Python unit test scripts (`tests/` directory).
*   A brief summary of manual test execution and any significant findings (can be part of the project submission or a README section).
*   The well-tested, deployed application itself is the primary deliverable.

## 10. Assumptions

*   The Davia SDK and platform reliably generate frontend components based on a correct OpenAPI specification. Testing will focus on the *interaction* with these components, not their internal implementation.
*   FastAPI's `TestClient` is sufficient for most backend API testing needs.

This testing strategy aims to provide confidence in the application's functionality and quality, appropriate for the scope of a job application project.
