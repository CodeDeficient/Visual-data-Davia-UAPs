# Project Schedule (High-Level)
## Project Title: Interactive UFO/UAP Sightings Explorer & AI Analyst

This document outlines a high-level, estimated schedule for the Interactive UFO/UAP Sightings Explorer project. Given this is a project for a job application, the timeline is condensed and assumes focused effort. The "Duration" is in conceptual "work sessions" or "days" of focused effort, not necessarily strict calendar days.

**Notes:**
*   This schedule is aggressive and assumes the developer can dedicate focused blocks of time.
*   Dependencies between tasks are critical (e.g., backend API must be somewhat stable before Davia integration).
*   Flexibility is key; some tasks might take longer or shorter than estimated.
*   "Work Sessions" can be interpreted as 2-4 hour blocks of focused work, or full days depending on availability. The goal is to complete this project in a timeframe suitable for a job application (e.g., 1-2 weeks of part-time to full-time effort).
