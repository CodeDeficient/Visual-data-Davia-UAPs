# Technology Stack Documentation

## 1. Introduction

**Project Title:** Interactive UFO/UAP Sightings Explorer & AI Analyst

This document details the technology stack chosen for the Interactive UFO/UAP Sightings Explorer application. The selection is guided by the project requirements, Davia AI's ecosystem (including their SDK and deployment recommendations), and the goal of using free-tier or cost-effective solutions.

## 2. Core Technologies

### 2.1. Davia Python SDK
*   **Role:** Primary tool for building the interactive data application. Davia's platform uses the OpenAPI specification from a Python backend to generate the frontend UI.
*   **Justification:** Mandatory requirement for the job application. The project aims to showcase proficiency with this specific SDK.
*   **Version:** Latest stable version available at the time of development.

### 2.2. Python
*   **Role:** Core programming language for the backend API and data processing logic.
*   **Justification:** Davia SDK is Python-based. Python is the language of choice for data science, with extensive libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and API development. Strong proficiency in Python is a key requirement for the target job role.
*   **Version:** Python 3.9+ (to ensure compatibility with modern libraries and Google Cloud Run).

## 3. Backend Technologies

### 3.1. FastAPI
*   **Role:** Web framework for building the Python backend API.
*   **Justification:**
    *   **Performance:** High-performance asynchronous framework, suitable for I/O-bound operations.
    *   **OpenAPI Support:** Automatic generation of OpenAPI 3.0 specification from Python code (including Pydantic models), which is crucial for integration with the Davia platform.
    *   **Ease of Use:** Modern, intuitive syntax, and excellent documentation.
    *   **Data Validation:** Built-in data validation using Pydantic models.
    *   Mentioned as a familiar framework in the job description.
*   **Version:** Latest stable version.

### 3.2. Pandas
*   **Role:** Library for data manipulation and analysis.
*   **Justification:** Essential for loading, cleaning, filtering, and aggregating the UFO/UAP sightings dataset. Industry standard for data science in Python.
*   **Version:** Latest stable version.

### 3.3. Uvicorn / Gunicorn (or similar ASGI server)
*   **Role:** ASGI server to run the FastAPI application within the Docker container on Google Cloud Run.
*   **Justification:** Uvicorn is recommended for FastAPI for its high performance. Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers is also a common production setup.
*   **Version:** Latest stable versions.

## 4. Frontend Technologies (Managed by Davia)

### 4.1. Davia UI Platform
*   **Role:** Generates and renders the frontend user interface.
*   **Justification:** This is the core of the Davia offering. The frontend is automatically built by Davia based on the OpenAPI specification exposed by the Python backend, **significantly streamlining development by abstracting frontend complexities and allowing Python developers to create interactive applications much faster.** The specific underlying technologies (e.g., React, Vue, etc.) are managed by Davia.
*   **Components:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (as managed and generated by Davia).

## 5. Data Storage and Format

### 5.1. Apache Parquet
*   **Role:** File format for storing the pre-processed UFO/UAP sightings dataset.
*   **Justification:**
    *   **Efficiency:** Columnar storage format that is highly efficient for analytical queries, offering better compression and faster read speeds with Pandas compared to CSV.
    *   **Size:** Smaller file sizes reduce storage and improve loading times, especially important for a serverless backend.
*   **Access:** The Parquet file will be bundled with the backend application and read locally by Pandas.

## 6. Deployment and Hosting

### 6.1. Vercel
*   **Role:** Hosting platform for the frontend application generated by Davia.
*   **Justification:** Specified in Davia's documentation as their recommended platform for frontend deployment. Offers excellent performance, CI/CD integration, and a generous free tier.
*   **Configuration:** Managed via Davia's deployment process or a `vercel.json` file if manual configuration is needed.

### 6.2. Google Cloud Run
*   **Role:** Hosting platform for the containerized Python backend API.
*   **Justification:** Specified in Davia's documentation as their recommended platform for backend deployment. Serverless platform that scales automatically (including to zero), cost-effective (generous free tier), and supports Docker containers.
*   **Containerization:** Docker will be used to package the Python application and its dependencies.

### 6.3. Docker
*   **Role:** Containerization technology for packaging the Python backend application.
*   **Justification:** Standard for creating portable and reproducible application environments. Required for deploying to Google Cloud Run.
*   **Components:** `Dockerfile` to define the image.

### 6.4. Google Container Registry (GCR) or Artifact Registry
*   **Role:** Storing the Docker image for the backend application.
*   **Justification:** Secure and integrated registry for Docker images, used by Google Cloud Run to pull images for deployment.

## 7. Development and Version Control

### 7.1. Git
*   **Role:** Version control system.
*   **Justification:** Industry standard for tracking changes, collaboration, and managing code history.
*   **Hosting (Implied):** A Git repository (e.g., on GitHub, GitLab) will be used to store the project code and documentation. This is also a requirement for the job application (sharing the deployed app link and potentially a GitHub repo link).

### 7.2. Visual Studio Code (or preferred IDE)
*   **Role:** Integrated Development Environment for coding and documentation.
*   **Justification:** Popular, feature-rich IDE with excellent Python support and extensions for various development tasks. (User's current environment).

## 8. AI Assistant Implementation (Rule-Based)

*   **Role:** Logic for the "AI" analytical assistant.
*   **Technology:** Standard Python control flow (if/else statements, string matching, regular expressions).
*   **Justification:** To meet the requirement for an AI-like feature while remaining entirely free and simple to implement. This approach avoids dependencies on external LLM APIs and their associated costs or rate limits for a demo project. It focuses on demonstrating the concept of a conversational interface.
