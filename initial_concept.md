Show thinking
Of course. This is an excellent way to approach a job application that requires a mini-project. Let's plan a data app that not only meets their requirements but also showcases your skills and creativity.

Based on the job description, Davia AI wants someone who can think like a product-focused data scientist. They value a "builder's mindset" and "product sense." The key is to create an app that is user-friendly and demonstrates a thoughtful use of their SDK, not necessarily something complex.

Here is a strategic plan to create an impressive data app for your application.

Step 1: Understand the Davia SDK (The Core Tool)
Before brainstorming, you need to understand what the Davia SDK can do. Your first step is to dive into their resources.

Explore the GitHub Repo: Visit https://github.com/davialabs/davia to see the code, understand the structure, and check out any examples they might have.
Read the Documentation: Go through https://docs.davia.ai/introduction thoroughly. Focus on the core components and how to create interactive elements. See what kind of UI elements (e.g., sliders, charts, text inputs) are available out-of-the-box. This will define the boundaries of what you can build quickly.
Step 2: Brainstorm Impressive Project Ideas
The goal is to pick a project that is interesting, highlights your skills, and is a good fit for what a data app does best: turning data into interactive insights. Here are three potential concepts, ranging from straightforward to more ambitious.

Idea A: The Interactive Data Exploration Tool üìà
This idea focuses on the core of data science: exploration and visualization. It's a classic and effective way to show your skills.

Concept: An app that allows a user to upload a small CSV file (or select from a few pre-loaded datasets) and instantly generate key statistics and visualizations.
Why it's impressive: It directly addresses the "explore, process, and interact with data" point in the job description. It shows you think about a common data scientist workflow.
Features to Include:
Dataset selection.
A display of the raw data (the first 5 or 10 rows).
An automated summary of statistics using Pandas' .describe() method.
Interactive plots: The user can select columns to generate histograms, scatter plots, or bar charts.
Idea B: The "What-If" Scenario Dashboard ‚öôÔ∏è
This idea showcases more "product sense" by creating a tool that helps a non-technical user make decisions.

Concept: A financial or business planning tool. For example, a "Startup Burn Rate Calculator" or a "Marketing Campaign ROI Predictor."
Why it's impressive: It shows you can build tools for end-users, a key aspect of the job. It's a practical application of a data model.
Features to Include:
Use sliders for inputs like "monthly ad spend," "new hires," or "customer conversion rate."
As the user adjusts the sliders, the app updates key outputs in real-time, such as "cash runway (months remaining)" or "projected revenue."
Display a chart that visualizes the projected outcome over time.
Idea C: The Mini AI Copilot ü§ñ
This is the most ambitious idea and hits on the "AI" aspect of the company. It uses a language model to make data interaction more conversational.

Concept: An app where a user can ask simple questions about a dataset in plain English and get back an answer or a visualization.
Why it's impressive: It aligns perfectly with the "AI copilots" use case mentioned in the job description and touches on LangGraph (which they mention is a plus).
Features to Include:
Load a specific dataset (e.g., data about global UFO sightings or S&P 500 stock performance).
A text input box for the user to ask a question like, "Which country has the most sightings?" or "What was the highest stock price for Apple in this dataset?"
Use a simple AI library or even a series of if/else statements to interpret the question and generate the correct data summary or plot from the Pandas DataFrame.
Step 3: Select a Great Dataset
The dataset you choose can make your project much more interesting. Avoid overly simple or common datasets like Iris or Titanic unless you have a very unique take.

Good Sources:
Kaggle Datasets: A great source for clean and interesting data.
Data.gov: U.S. government's open data.
Google Dataset Search: A search engine for datasets.
Recommendation: Pick a dataset that tells a story and is fun to explore. This makes your application more memorable.
Step 4: Plan Your Submission
Once your app is built and deployed, the final step is to contact them.

Deploy the App: Follow Davia's documentation to deploy your application. Get the public link.
Write a Clear Email: When you email them, keep it concise and professional.
Subject: Data Scientist Application - [Your Name] - Data App Submission
Body: Briefly introduce yourself and the app you built. Explain why you chose this project idea and what you wanted to demonstrate with it (this shows your "product sense"). Include the link to your deployed app and, if possible, a link to your code on GitHub.
By following this plan, you'll create a thoughtful application that directly addresses what Davia AI is looking for and sets you apart from other candidates. Good luck!





I like the idea of a web app that uses something like UFO sightings or a data set that's publicly available. and also like to consider the possibility that a lot of the tools that I would need to build this or apis or data sets might not be free so I'd like to keep things as free as possible even if I decide to use an AI agent to communicate with the data it needs to be done in a way that is so cheap it's




Show thinking
Excellent. Let's refine the plan based on that. The UFO sightings idea is perfect because it's engaging and lends itself well to interactive exploration. Most importantly, we can absolutely build a compelling app using entirely free resources.

The constraint of keeping everything free (or practically free) is not a blocker; it's a great engineering challenge that demonstrates resourcefulness.

Here is a revised, cost-conscious plan for a "UFO Sightings AI Explorer" app.

Step 1: Secure a Free, High-Quality Dataset
You're in luck. There is a fantastic, well-documented, and free dataset perfect for this project.

Primary Candidate: The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) Database. It's one of the largest and most detailed collections of UFO sighting reports. A cleaned version containing over 80,000 reports is readily available on Kaggle.
Direct Link: NUFORC UFO Sightings Dataset on Kaggle
Why it's perfect:
Rich Data: Contains columns like datetime, city, state, country, shape, duration, and comments. This is ideal for filtering and visualization.
Text Field for AI: The comments column is a text description of the sighting, which is exactly what you need for an AI-powered feature.
Completely Free: Downloading the CSV from Kaggle costs nothing.
Step 2: Design the Core Interactive App (No AI yet)
First, build a solid, interactive data app using just the Davia SDK and Pandas. This fulfills the main requirement of the application.

Feature: Interactive Filtering
Map: Display sightings on a map of the US or the world. This is visually impressive. You can use a library like plotly or folium if the Davia SDK integrates with them, or simply plot latitude/longitude on a scatter plot.
Filters: Add interactive widgets (which should be core to the Davia SDK) to filter the data in real-time:
Date Range Slider: To select sightings within a specific time period.
Dropdown for Shape: To filter by UFO shape (e.g., "light," "triangle," "circle").
Dropdown for State/Country: To narrow down the location.
Feature: Key Metrics Display
Create dynamic text readouts that update as you filter the data:
"Total Sightings in Selection: [Number]"
"Most Common Shape: [Shape]"
"Month with Most Sightings: [Month]"
This core app alone meets their criteria of an "interactive data app" and shows strong proficiency in data manipulation and visualization.

Step 3: Implement a "So Cheap It's Free" AI Agent
Now for the impressive part: adding an AI-powered chat feature without the cost. The key is to avoid paid API calls to services like OpenAI's GPT-4 for every query. Here are a few ways to achieve this, from simplest to most advanced.

Option A: The "Rule-Based AI" (Easiest & Most Reliable)
This approach mimics an AI agent by using clever programming instead of a true Large Language Model (LLM). It's robust and completely free.

How it Works: You create a text input box where the user can type a question. Your Python code then checks for keywords in the user's query and maps them to a specific Pandas function.
Example Queries you can program it to answer:
User types: "How many sightings were in California?" -> Your code looks for "How many" and "California", then runs df[df['state'] == 'ca'].shape[0] and returns the result.
User types: "Show me triangle shapes" -> Your code looks for "triangle" and filters the DataFrame, then updates the visual charts.
User types: "What are the most common shapes?" -> Your code runs df['shape'].value_counts().head(5) and displays the result.
Why it's great: It feels like an AI to the end-user for specific, pre-defined questions. It is 100% free, runs instantly, and perfectly demonstrates the "AI copilot" concept in a clever way.
Option B: Use a Free, Open-Source LLM (More Advanced)
If you want to use a genuine LLM, you can use a smaller, open-source model that has a generous free tier.

How it Works: Use the Hugging Face ecosystem. Many powerful models can be interacted with via their free inference API. You could use a model specifically designed for "Text-to-SQL" or question-answering.
Recommended Tool: The transformers library by Hugging Face.
Workflow:
When a user asks a question (e.g., "Which city in Texas had the longest sighting?"), your app sends this query to the free Hugging Face API along with the context of your data's column names.
The model's job is not to answer directly but to translate the natural language question into a Pandas query (e.g., df[df['state'] == 'tx'].sort_values('duration (seconds)', ascending=False).head(1)['city']).
Your app receives this code, executes it securely, and displays the result.
Cost: Hugging Face offers generous free tiers for their inference API, which would be more than enough for a project of this scale. It remains effectively free.
Final Project Outline:
Project Title: Interactive UFO Sightings Explorer & AI Analyst
Core Components (Built with Davia SDK):
An interactive map/chart showing UFO sighting locations.
A set of user-friendly filters (date, shape, state).
A summary statistics section that updates dynamically.
Impress Factor (The AI Chat):
An input box labeled "Ask a question about the data..."
Implement Option A (Rule-Based) for reliability and cost-effectiveness. It will impress them by showing you can creatively solve a problem without relying on expensive tools.
Submission:
Deploy the app.
In your email, highlight your choices: "I chose the NUFORC dataset because of its rich features for exploration. To build the AI chat feature, I developed a lightweight, rule-based engine to demonstrate how a conversational interface could work efficiently without the overhead of a full LLM, focusing on a practical and scalable solution."
This plan gives you a clear path to building a creative, impressive, and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîfree application that directly targets all the key skills and mindsets Davia AI is looking for.






Okay something else to consider is this app would be deployed on Vercel



Show thinking
That's a fantastic and important detail. Deploying on Vercel is a modern and professional choice, but it has specific technical requirements for Python applications. This changes our implementation strategy, but not the core idea.

Vercel is primarily built for frontend frameworks and serverless functions. It doesn't run a Python script like a traditional, always-on server. Instead, it runs your Python code as a Serverless Function that starts up when a request comes in and shuts down afterward.

Here is the updated plan, tailored for a Vercel deployment.

Step 1: Check Davia's Documentation for Vercel Deployment
This is now your most critical first step. The company wants you to succeed with their SDK. Check their docs (https://docs.davia.ai) or their GitHub repo for a page titled "Deployment," "Vercel," "Serverless," or something similar.

If they have a Vercel guide: Follow it exactly. This is your best-case scenario.
If they don't: The following plan is your best path forward. It's based on how Vercel handles standard Python web frameworks like FastAPI, which they mentioned in the job description.
Step 2: Structure Your Project for Vercel
You can't just have a single app.py file in the root directory. Vercel needs a specific structure to know how to deploy your Python code.

Your project folder should look like this:

/
|-- api/
|   |-- index.py      # Your main Python/FastAPI/Davia app code goes here
|-- data/
|   |-- nuforc_data.parquet # Your smaller, processed data file
|-- requirements.txt  # Lists your Python dependencies (davia, pandas, etc.)
|-- vercel.json       # Vercel configuration file
api/index.py: This is the magic file. Vercel automatically looks for a Python file in the /api directory to serve as the serverless function.
vercel.json: This file tells Vercel how to build your project. It will look something like this:
JSON

{
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "api/index.py",
      "use": "@vercel/python"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "api/index.py"
    }
  ]
}
Step 3: Handle the Data Efficiently (Crucial for Serverless)
Serverless functions can be slow if they have to load large files on every request. The 80,000-row NUFORC dataset might be too slow.

Pre-process the Data: Write a separate, one-time script (don't include it in the deployment) to clean and shrink the dataset.
Download the CSV from Kaggle.
Remove columns you don't need.
Filter out rows with missing essential data (like state or shape).
Save it in a more efficient format. Save the cleaned data as a Parquet file (.parquet). Parquet is much smaller and faster for Pandas to read than CSV.
Bundle the Small Data File: Place your new, smaller nuforc_data.parquet file in a data/ directory. Your Vercel serverless function will read from this local file. This is fast and reliable.
Step 4: Write the Vercel-Compatible Davia App
Now, let's write the code for api/index.py. The goal is to create a FastAPI application that Vercel can serve, and then let the Davia SDK work within that.

Your api/index.py will likely look something like this:

Python

# api/index.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
import davia
import pandas as pd

# Create a FastAPI app instance. Vercel will look for this 'app' variable.
app = FastAPI()

# --- Load Your Data ---
# Load the pre-processed data that you bundled with your app.
# This runs once when the serverless function "wakes up."
try:
    df = pd.read_parquet("data/nuforc_data.parquet")
except Exception as e:
    # Fallback in case the file path is tricky on Vercel
    df = pd.read_parquet("../data/nuforc_data.parquet")


# --- Initialize Your Davia App ---
# This is a guess at how the Davia SDK might work.
# You might initialize it directly, or mount it on the FastAPI app.
# Refer to Davia's docs to see the correct way.

# Example:
davia_app = davia.App(title="UFO Sightings Explorer")

# Add your interactive components to the Davia app
# (sliders, charts, etc., using the dataframe 'df')
# ... your Davia component code goes here ...

# --- Connect Davia to FastAPI ---
# Mount the Davia app onto your main FastAPI app.
# The Davia documentation should specify how to do this.
app.mount("/", davia_app)

# This structure allows Vercel to serve your Davia app
# because it's wrapped in a standard FastAPI object.
The core idea (UFO Explorer) and the "free AI" approach remain exactly the same. The only thing that changes is the project structure and the Python script's boilerplate, to make it compatible with Vercel's serverless environment.

By thinking through these deployment details, you are demonstrating a senior level of understanding that goes beyond just writing a script‚Äîyou're showing you can build and ship a real product. This is a huge plus.
