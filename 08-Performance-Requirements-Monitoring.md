# Performance Requirements and Monitoring

## 1. Introduction

**Project Title:** Interactive UFO/UAP Sightings Explorer & AI Analyst

This document outlines the performance requirements and basic monitoring considerations for the Interactive UFO/UAP Sightings Explorer application. While this is a demonstration project not intended for high-scale production use, ensuring a responsive user experience is important.

## 2. Performance Goals

The primary performance goal is to provide a smooth and interactive user experience when exploring the UFO/UAP sightings data.

### 2.1. Frontend Responsiveness (Davia UI on Vercel)
*   **PGR1:** Initial application load time (time to first interactive elements appear) should be within 3-5 seconds on a reasonably fast internet connection.
*   **PGR2:** UI interactions (e.g., clicking a filter, typing in the AI query box) should feel immediate, with visual feedback occurring within 200-300 milliseconds.

### 2.2. API Response Times (Python Backend on Google Cloud Run)
*   **PGR3:** API endpoints for data filtering and fetching summary metrics should respond within 1-2 seconds for typical queries on the pre-processed dataset. This includes:
    *   Time taken by Google Cloud Run to instantiate the container (if cold start).
    *   Time taken by Pandas to load/filter data from the Parquet file.
    *   Time taken by FastAPI to process the request and serialize the response.
*   **PGR4:** The AI assistant query endpoint (`/ai-query`) should respond within 1-2 seconds for its rule-based processing.

### 2.3. Data Processing Efficiency
*   **PGR5:** The pre-processed Parquet file should be optimized for quick loading into a Pandas DataFrame.
*   **PGR6:** Pandas operations (filtering, aggregation) in the backend should be efficient and avoid unnecessary computations.

## 3. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

*   **Frontend Load Time:** Measured from navigation start to when the main UI elements are interactive.
*   **API Request Latency:** Time taken for the backend API to process a request and send a response. This can be broken down by endpoint.
*   **Data Update Latency:** Time taken from a user interaction (e.g., applying a filter) to the UI reflecting the updated data. This is a combined frontend and backend KPI.
*   **Error Rates:** API error rates (e.g., HTTP 5xx errors) should be near zero.

## 4. Monitoring Strategy

Given the demo nature of the project, extensive, dedicated monitoring tools will not be set up. Monitoring will rely on built-in features of the hosting platforms and manual observation during testing.

### 4.1. Vercel (Frontend)
*   **Vercel Analytics:** Vercel provides some basic analytics for deployed projects, which can offer insights into page load times (Real Experience Score) and traffic. This will be reviewed post-deployment.
*   **Browser Developer Tools:** During manual testing, browser developer tools (Network tab, Performance tab) will be used to inspect load times, asset sizes, and identify any frontend bottlenecks.

### 4.2. Google Cloud Run (Backend)
*   **Cloud Logging & Cloud Monitoring:** Google Cloud Run automatically integrates with Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring.
    *   **Logs:** API request logs (including latency, status codes) will be available in Cloud Logging. These can be used to manually check response times and identify errors.
    *   **Metrics:** Cloud Monitoring provides metrics for Cloud Run services, such as request count, request latencies (e.g., p50, p95, p99), container instance count, CPU and memory utilization. These will be reviewed post-deployment to understand backend performance.
*   **FastAPI Logging:** Custom logging can be added to the FastAPI application to output specific performance markers or processing times for complex operations if needed during development.

### 4.3. Manual Performance Testing
*   During frontend functional testing and UAT, perceived performance will be noted.
*   Specific test cases will involve applying complex filter combinations or querying the AI assistant to observe response times.

## 5. Performance Optimization Considerations

### 5.1. Data Preprocessing
*   The offline data preprocessing step is crucial:
    *   Selecting only necessary columns.
    *   Using appropriate data types.
    *   Saving in Parquet format for efficient reads.
    *   This minimizes the data size and improves Pandas read/processing speed.

### 5.2. Backend API
*   **Efficient Pandas Code:** Use vectorized operations in Pandas where possible, avoid slow loops.
*   **Asynchronous Operations (FastAPI):** While the current backend logic (reading a local file) might not heavily benefit from async for file I/O itself, FastAPI's async nature helps in handling concurrent requests efficiently if the Cloud Run instance serves multiple users (unlikely for a demo, but good practice).
*   **Cold Starts (Google Cloud Run):**
    *   Be mindful of cold start times. Keeping the container image small and application initialization fast can help.
    *   Setting a minimum number of instances (e.g., 1) on Cloud Run can mitigate cold starts but incurs cost, so this will likely be kept at 0 for the free tier unless performance is severely impacted during evaluation.
*   **Caching (Out of Scope for v1 Demo):** For a production app, caching frequently accessed data or filter option results would be considered.

### 5.3. Frontend
*   Since the frontend is Davia-generated, direct optimization is limited. However, ensuring the API responses are concise and provide only necessary data can help reduce data transfer and frontend processing load.

## 6. Performance Testing

*   No formal load testing tools will be used.
*   Performance testing will be integrated into manual functional testing by observing response times for various interactions.
*   The primary goal is to ensure the application feels responsive to a single user (the evaluator).

This performance and monitoring plan focuses on achieving a good user experience for a demonstration application while leveraging the built-in capabilities of the chosen cloud platforms.
