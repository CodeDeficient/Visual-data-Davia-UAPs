# Project Overview and Documentation Index

## Project Title: Interactive UFO/UAP Sightings Explorer & AI Analyst

**Project Goal:** To develop an interactive data application that allows users to explore a dataset of UFO/UAP sightings, filter data, view visualizations, and interact with a simple AI-powered analytical assistant. The application will be built using the Davia Python SDK and deployed with a frontend on Vercel and a backend on Google Cloud Run. This project serves as a demonstration of skills for a Data Scientist position at Davia AI.

**Core Objective:** Fulfill the application requirement for Davia AI by building a creative and thoughtful data app using the Davia Python SDK, showcasing proficiency in Python, data handling, API design, and an understanding of user-centric product development.
